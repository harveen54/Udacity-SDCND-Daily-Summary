1. Canny Edge Detection on a high level http://justin-liang.com/tutorials/canny/
2. Converting image to grayscale using opencv
3. Finding edges using canny edge detection

## 15/01/2018
1. Started with Project 1
2. Learnt how to read an image and detect lane lines by thresholding the color values
3. Learnt how to do region selection
4. Combination of region selection and color selection to select lane lines
5. Functions learnt- np.arange, np.meshgrid, np.polyfit
6. Learnt that the origin of an image is at the top left corner and y increases downwards and x increases downwards
7. Learnt how to get area bounded by the triangle after getting in the m and c parameters from np.polyfit
8. Plotting line on an image- make one array of x points and one array of y points and use pyplot.plot(x,y,'bo-',linewidth)
9. Usage of pyplot
